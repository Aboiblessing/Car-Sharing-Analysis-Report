# Car Sharing Report With SQL Queries
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a carsharing demand dataset using SQL queries to extract insights and inform business decisions. The dataset contains information on carsharing transactions, including demand patterns, customer behavior, and environmental factors collected on an hourly basis between January 2017 and August 2018.
